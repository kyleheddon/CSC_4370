      <h3>Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</h3>
      <p>
        In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the
        calories they contain, we created a Recipe Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the
        recipes that are especially rich in particular nutrients. The following chart shows the nutrients
        for which 15-Minute Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad is either an excellent, very good, or good source
        (below the chart you will find a table that explains these qualifications). If a nutrient is not
        listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the recipe doesn't contain it. It simply
        means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount or concentration to meet our rating
        criteria. (To view this recipe's in-depth nutritional profile that includes values for dozens of
        nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, very good, or good - please use the link below
        the chart.) To read this chart accurately, you'll need to glance back up to see the ingredients used
        in the recipe and the number of serving sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient ratings are based
        on a single serving. For example, if a recipe makes 4 servings, you would be receiving the nutrient
        amounts listed in the chart by eating 1/4th of the combined ingredients found in the recipe. Now,
        returning to the chart itself, you can look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient
        amount it offers, the percent Daily Value (DV%) that this amount represents, the nutrient density
        that we calculated for this recipe and nutrient, and the rating we established in our rating system.
        For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government standards for food labeling that are
        found in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling." Read
        more background information and details of our rating system.
